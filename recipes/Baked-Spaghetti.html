  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
    </li>
    <li>
      1 pound ground beef
    </li>
    <li>
      1 onion, chopped
    </li>
    <li>
      1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce
    </li>
    <li>
      ½ teaspoon seasoned salt
    </li>
    <li>
      2 eggs
    </li>
    <li>
      ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
    </li>
    <li>
      5 tablespoons butter, melted
    </li>
    <li>
      2 cups small curd cottage cheese, divided
    </li>
    <li>
      5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
      Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
      until tender but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet
      until meat is browned and onion is soft and translucent, about 7 minutes. Drain
      excess oil from the pan. Stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and toss to coat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared dish. Top with 1/2 of the cottage
      cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of meat sauce. Repeat layers. Cover with
      aluminum foil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle with
      remaining mozzarella. Continue to bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned,
      20 to 25 minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>
